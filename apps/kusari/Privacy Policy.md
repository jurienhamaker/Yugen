-   `inGuild` whether the user is still part of the Server.

### Updating Data

The data may be updated when using specific commands.  
Updating data will require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

Participation in games can also update the User's information, this will only update the 3 mentioned keys excluding `id` stated earlier.

### Temporarely stored Information

The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.  
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data

#### Automatic removal

Stored Server Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.

User's data can not be removed automatically.

#### Manual removal

Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at [info@jurien.dev](mailto:info@jurien.dev).
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
